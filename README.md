Saildeck lets you activate and deactivate mods for Ship of Harkinian.
It is a spiritual successor to Shiploader (https://gamebanana.com/tools/16326) with support for .otr files and .o2r files.

Currently, the v1.0.3 only let you manage your mods + some extra features. In future releases, will be added support from Gamebanana with a downloader directly into the mod manager.

# How to use

First, Saildeck will ask you to choose your Ship of Harkinian folder, then it will effortlessly load mods from the "mods" folder.
Simply double-click or select the mod and hit the "Toggle mod state" button in order to change the state of a mod.

# TODO list:
  - Adding support for Gamebanana using their API
  - Adding a downloader with scrapping

This project has been written in python.

Thank you for reading and have a good day!
